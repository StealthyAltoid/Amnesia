Intro/Instructions:
You wake up in a musty, dimly lit room. Your head throbs and you are slumped
against one a corner. All you can see is a single door set into the wall across
from you. You struggle to remember how you got here but can't. Not only that, 
you can't seem to recall anything... not even your name. You fish around in your
pocket and find a note that reads:

Once in my brain, first in my boot
I don't like one, my favorite number is two  

A riddle... strange. Oh well, first things first: better try to get out of here.

the young United States and France."

Blah, blah, blah.

Hall:

You are in a long corridor. Across from you is an archway leading into another
room. You check down the hall and see that there are also rooms to your right and
left. 
	Options:
	1) Straight
	2) Right
	3) Left
	

Room 1:

A rat scurries over your foot and into a hole in the wall. You look around and see
this room appears to have been used as an office. Papers are strewn about the 
floor and across the desk that occupies one corner. Underneath the desk is a worn
out chest.

	1) Look in the Chest
	2) Search the papers

staircase that goes down.

	1) Search the boxes
	2) Take the stairs

Room 3: 

Books are haphazardly organized across bookcases which line each wall. The
wallpaper has peeled off hangs down over the top of the bookshelves. In the center
of the room is a cracked floor board that is not secure. 

	Options: 
	1) Investigate the bookshelves
	2) Check the floorboard
	3) Leave

Room 4: 

You walk in the room and see a chart of a piano across from you with the lowest
D, G, and C circled. Interesting... You turn around and walk out. 

Room 5:

You find yourself in a large chamber that looks more like part of a warehouse
than a house. Beer cans are stacked into a mountain in the middle of the room and
chicken bones occupy one corner. Up against the wall is a crumbling grand piano.
You notice doors to three other rooms: one with a purple door, one with a green,
and one with a blue.

	2) Search the beer cans
	3) Investigate the bones
	4) Go to purple door

Room 6: 

The room appears only to be a landing for a long, spiral staircase which descends
even further. 

	Options:
	1) Take the stairs
	2) Leave

Room 7:

This is a hoarder's paradise. Every knick knack conceivable fills the room. Just
beside the door frame you notice a key ring with a single key looped over the
end. 

	Options:
	1) Search trash
	2) Take Key
	3) Leave

Room 8:

You step into the room and are suddenly grabbed by a large viny plant covering
every wall! You struggle to get loose and eventually wrest yourself free and
slam the door on your way out. 

With vine killer:

You step into the room and quickly whip out the herbicide, spraying it all around
you. The malicious vines quickly turn brown and wither lifelessly, revealing a
small slip of paper in the center of the room. 

	Options:
	1) Take Paper
	2) Leave

Book Name:

"Great Expectations"

Hmm... a book title. 

Room 10:

You step into a study with charts on every wall. There is a map of Europe tacked
to one wall. A sticky note is attached to the map. You barely make out two doors
to another room in the darkness: one directly in front of you and one directly
to your left.   

	Options:
	1) Investigate charts
	2) Take note
	3) Go straight
	4) Go left
	5) Leave

Hall #2:

You are in a narrow corridor. There appears to be one room in front of you and
one just around a bend in the hallway. Of course, there's the room behind you too.

	Options:
	1) Go back
	2) Go forward
	3) Go around the corner
